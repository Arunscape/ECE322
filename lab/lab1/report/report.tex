 \section*{Introduction}
 The purpose of this lab was to serve as a practical introduction to rudimentary black-box testing techniques.
 The testing methods introduced were dirty testing, error guessing, and partition-based testing.
 It should be noted that numerous other black-box testing methods exist
 The idea of black-box testing is that tests are carried out with no knowledge of how the software
 internally works. In other words, the implementation details are a ``black box'' as the name would suggest.

\section*{Part 1 - Failure/Dirty Testing, Error Guessing}
For task one in this lab, we had to be creative, as is the nature of Failure/Dirty testing, and error guessing.
The purpose was to test the functionality of a calculator program, which was written in Java. A table of
test cases was produced, checking for basic functionality, common errors. A few test cases were also 
made based on previous experience, which is also known as error guessing. Altogether, the test cases check
for the following functionality:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item whether the calculator buttons work
    \item non-numerical input
    \item mismatched brackets
    \item order or operations (BEDMAS/PEMDAS)
    \item large numbers
    \item small numbers
    \item incorrect syntax (e.g. 2++2)
\end{enumerate}

The full list of test cases, along with the inputs and expected versus actual outputs can be found in Appendix \ref{calculatortestcases}.
The test cases where the expected result does not match the actual result are highlighted in red.


\section*{Part 2 - Partition Testing}

\subsection*{Triangle Equivalence Classes}
\subsubsection*{Valid}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $a + b > c$
    \item Equilateral
    \item Isoscoles
    \item Scalene
    \item 3 arguments
    \item separated by one space
    \item positive integers
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Invalid}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $a + b = c$
    \item $ a + b < c$
    \item $< 3$ arguments
    \item $> 3$ arguments
    \item separated by more than one space
    \item negative argument
    \item argument with the number `0'
    \item decimal argument
\end{enumerate}
